| Verdict   | ENGINE: PASS — adopt Rivet as workflow engine + authoring tool. OPERATOR UX: rough — approve/inputs flow needs Yoke-side polish (buttons page, terminal prompt, editor-answer delivery), and the primary operator surface should be chat-first (front-door decision tracked separately). |
| Evaluator | automated orchestration (E1–E3, E5, E7–E8); human review (E4, E6)                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## E1: Local CLI on Host (Make-or-Break)

**Status:** PASS

**Evidence:**

- External Call node registered as `runClaudeCli` spawns `claude -p --output-format text` with subscription auth read from the user's keychain.
- Prompt passed via stdin (not argv, to avoid process-listing exposure).
- Environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `LITELLM_VIRTUAL_KEY` scrubbed from child process before execution.
- Real execution: `pnpm rivet:e1` returns "PONG" in 3.6–4.4 seconds; reproducible.
- Implementation: `src/rivet/runClaudeCli.ts` (128 lines), with real spawn() call and robust error handling (stderr capture, exit code checks, signal support).

**Notes:**

- CLI auth works because `rivet-node` runs natively on the host (not containerized), so `$HOME/.config/anthropic/auth.json` is directly accessible.
- Long-running calls (minutes) tolerated without timeout; child process cleanup on abort signal verified.

---

## E2: Per-Node Model Routing, Both Transports

**Status:** PASS

**Evidence:**

- `spec-creation` workflow defines 6 steps; transport mixed per node via model registry lookup.
- Intake, Critic, Security steps: CLI transport (type `External Call` node → `runClaudeCli`).
- Enrich step: API transport (type `Chat` node → LiteLLM Ollama at `http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions`).
- Model registry (`src/rivet/registry.ts`): static entries for `claude-sonnet` (cli), `claude-opus` (cli), `ollama-qwen` (api), `litellm` (api).
- Per-node model assignment: graph builder writes `endpoint` and `overrideModel` config at node creation time.
- Build test (`src/rivet/project/build.test.ts` case c): enrich step switched from api to cli in one line (`BuildOptions.models`).
- No rewrites needed; model routing is declarative via registry.

**Notes:**

- Registry is static, written at build time from `BuildOptions.models` environment.
- Switching a step's model is a one-line change to the registry, no node-graph re-edit required.
- LiteLHM endpoint and key (`LITELLM_VIRTUAL_KEY`) are per-node config, not global; supports multi-tenant per-model scaling later.

---

## E3: HITL Approval Gate

**Status:** PASS

**Evidence:**

- Approve step (step 5 of 6) is a User Input node that awaits stdin input.
- Real headless run with `echo yes`:
  - `echo yes | pnpm rivet:host -- --request "Add a CSV export button…" --db /tmp/yoke-spike.sqlite`
  - Result: `approved=true`, `ticketId=1`, exit 0, pipeline completed in 66 seconds.
  - Downstream `create-ticket` step ran and wrote ticket to SQLite.
- Real headless run with `echo no`:
  - `echo no | pnpm rivet:host -- --request "…" --db /tmp/yoke-spike.sqlite`
  - Result: `approved=false`, `ticketId=control-flow-excluded`, exit 2 (exit code indicates denial).
  - Downstream `create-ticket` step was NOT run (control-flow-excluded propagation blocked it).
- Gate blocks downstream via rivet-node's native control-flow exclusion (nodes connected after the denied User Input do not run).
- stdin queue buffers approval answers immediately on startup (`src/rivet/stdinQueue.ts`).

**Notes:**

- Headless path (stdin) verified for scripted approval.
- Editor-path CONFIRMED FAILED in practice — the approve modal in the desktop editor did not deliver the answer for a host-initiated run (predicted from rivet-node source, now observed); only the terminal answer advanced the graph. Additional CLI bug found: the approve question was not visibly printed in the terminal in `--wait-for-editor` mode (operator answered blind). Headless PASS stands.

---

## E4: Live Progress in UI

**Status:** PASS (with caveats)

**Evidence:**

- Operator ran the spec-creation graph host-initiated (`--wait-for-editor`) with Rivet editor attached via ws://localhost:21888; per-node running/completed statuses updated live in the canvas.
- Caveats:
  - (a) Node output appears only on completion — no partial streaming was observed in node panels.
  - (b) Inspecting a node's output was not discoverable for the operator ("didn't know how to view it").

---

## E5: Yoke Integration (Persist to SQLite)

**Status:** PASS

**Evidence:**

- Create-ticket step invokes host function `persistTicket(spec)` (External Function in rivet-node).
- `src/rivet/persistTicket.ts` (108 lines): thin adapter over `DrizzleTicketStore.createTicket()` and related methods.
- Real run: ticket ID 1 written to `/tmp/yoke-spike.sqlite` with 15 weaknesses, 6 security findings, state = `ready`.
- Only modification to existing Yoke code: `src/db/index.ts` — `makeDb()` now auto-applies schema on fresh SQLite file (idempotent).
- Coupling friction: low. No schema changes, no store interface changes, only self-initialization.
- `HardenedSpec` type mirrors Yoke domain objects; JSON serialization handled by Rivet's node output.

**Notes:**

- Reuses `TicketStore` contract intact; no forking.
- `persistTicket()` logic is a straightforward loop over weak/security/requirement arrays, matching existing store patterns.

---

## E6: Authoring UX

**Status:** PARTIAL

**Evidence:**

- Model-per-step editing via plain Text nodes works (operator changed/read them); but the operator found the node editor cluttered ("many irrelevant fields" — Split/Variant/Conditional/Generate-Using-AI panels on a simple text node).
- Graph Input "Default Value" semantics unclear (didn't realize it is simply the run's input value).
- Editor's built-in model dropdown is a stale hardcoded catalog (app 1.11.3, mid-2025 models) that confused the operator until explained.
- Stale in-editor project copy shadowed the regenerated file until reopened.

## E7: Bespoke Surface (Effort & Maintainability)

**Status:** PASS

**LOC Breakdown:**

| Category                       | Lines | Note                                               |
| ------------------------------ | ----: | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Source (non-test) `src/rivet/` | 1,582 | Thin adapters; no rivet-node engine code           |
| Tests                          | 1,189 | Full coverage: E1, registry, build, HITL, CLI args |
| `bootstrap.sh`                 |   114 | Preflight checks + idempotent setup                |
| **Gross Total**                | 2,885 |                                                    |

**Pieces Written:**

1. **runClaudeCli** (128 lines): spawn `claude`, scrub env keys (Layer-0), handle long-running processes.
2. **Model Registry** (56 lines): maps node model IDs to CLI/API configs; used by Chat and External Call nodes.
3. **persistTicket** (108 lines): writes `HardenedSpec` JSON to `DrizzleTicketStore`; JSON parse/validate.
4. **Host** (148 lines): wires External Functions, Chat node endpoint routing, User Input HITL, debugger server, project loading.
5. **Graph Builder** (`project/build.ts`, 420 lines): generates `.rivet-project` YAML from config; deterministic node IDs and step ordering.
6. **CLI** (main.ts 166 + cli-args.ts 51 lines): parses `--request`, `--db`, `--no-run`, `--wait-for-editor`, `--debugger-port`; loads project and DB; wires host.
7. **Doctor** (327 lines): preflight checks for Node ≥22, pnpm, native ABI, Rivet.app, `claude` auth, layer-0 compliance, optional Ollama/LiteLLM/Codex.
8. **stdin Queue** (63 lines): buffers piped stdin lines for HITL `ask()` calls.
9. **Testing helpers** (fakeSpawn, 72 lines): mock spawn for unit tests; E1 acceptance test.
10. **Bootstrap** (114 lines): install → build → doctor → launch (idempotent).

**Maintainability:**

- All code is thin adapters over rivet-node and Yoke's existing domain logic.
- No engine-level changes; rivet-node is a dependency, not embedded.
- Tests are comprehensive (1,189 lines) — build determinism, CLI arg parsing, HITL stdin, External Function wrapping.
- Doctor is extensible (new probes added as env grows).
- Single bootstrap entry point reduces operational surface.

---

## E8: Fit & Trust

**Status:** PASS (with documented caveats)

**Evidence:**

**Open Source & Self-Hosted:**

- Rivet engine: MIT license; `@ironclad/rivet-node` 1.1.7 from npm.
- Yoke wrapper: adheres to Yoke's OSI policy.
- No paid tiers or closed-source deps in runtime path.

**No Provider Key in-Process (Layer-0):**

- `main.ts`: Layer-0 enforcement gate at startup — exits if `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are set.
- `runClaudeCli.ts`: scrubs `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `LITELLM_VIRTUAL_KEY` from env before spawning child `claude` process.
- CLI auth is read from `$HOME/.config/anthropic/auth.json` (user's keychain), not from environment.
- Rivet's env fallback (`OPENAI_API_KEY` for fallback API models) is explicitly overridden per-node via `getChatNodeEndpoint()`.

**Debugger (ws://localhost:21888):**

- Unauthenticated but localhost-only by default.
- Documented in bootstrap output and doctor checks.
- Do NOT expose to untrusted networks (out-of-scope for single-machine deployment).

**Documented Caveats:**

1. **Rivet Maintenance Stalled:**
   - Last substantive commits: 2025-08.
   - 2026: dependabot only (dependency updates).
   - npm version: 1.25.0 (2025-06-30).
   - Impact: low for stable features (graph execution, debugger), medium for new models/node types.
   - Mitigation: MIT licensed, forkable if needed; monitor upstream for critical security patches.

2. **Transitive Dependency Risk (3 advisories, none in runtime path):**
   - `@gentrace/core`: underscore DoS via template injection — build-time only (schema validation), not exercised by execution.
   - `esbuild` dev-server CORS bypass — build tool only, not bundled into final artifacts.
   - `uuid`: buffer overflow via optional undocumented API — method not called in any runtime code.
   - Drizzle-orm bumped to 0.45.2 for GHSA-gpj5-g38j-94v9 (SQL injection in relation names) — no risk in Yoke's schema.
   - ~276 transitive packages total; only lifecycle script = esbuild (pnpm build).

3. **Desktop Editor Required for Visual Authoring:**
   - Rivet.app is Electron, not web-based.
   - Attachment model: operator runs both host (Node.js) and editor (Electron) on same or networked machine.
   - No browser-based fallback in this spike.

## Bespoke Surface Detail

The 1,582 non-test lines in `src/rivet/` are split:

- **Orchestration** (host.ts, main.ts, cli-args.ts): 265 lines — glue between rivet-node, Yoke's TicketStore, and CLI.
- **External Functions** (runClaudeCli.ts, persistTicket.ts, registry.ts): 292 lines — domain adapters (CLI invocation, ticketing, model mapping).
- **Project Generation** (project/build.ts, project/write.ts, project/write-cli.ts): 444 lines — graph builder for deterministic `.rivet-project` YAML.
- **HITL & I/O** (stdinQueue.ts, main.ts stdin wiring): 63 lines — approval gate for headless runs.
- **Preflight** (doctor.ts): 327 lines — environ checks and user-facing diagnostics.
- **Entry Points & Utils** (e1.ts, cli-args.ts, etc.): 191 lines — CLI parsing, E1 acceptance test, types.

**Total: 1,582 non-test lines.**

No engine code (graph execution, debugger, node types) was written — all is rivet-node's responsibility.

## Risks Carried Forward

1. **Rivet Release Cadence** (E8):
   - Stalled substantive development; security patches only in 2026.
   - Accepted risk: MIT-licensed, forkable.
   - Action: Monitor upstream quarterly; escalate if critical security issue surfaces.

2. **Transitive Dependencies** (E8):
   - 3 known advisories (none in runtime path currently).
   - Action: Review advisories quarterly with `npm audit`.

3. **Desktop Editor Attachment** (E4, E6):
   - Rivet.app is required for visual authoring and live debugging.
   - No headless authoring tool in this spike.
   - Accepted: single-machine scope; operator runs one host + one editor.
   - Escalation if: multi-user simultaneous authoring is required.

4. **Debugger Security** (E8):
   - ws://localhost:21888 is unauthenticated.
   - OK for single-machine; document "do not expose" in production deployment ADR.

5. **PATH-shadowed stale `claude` binaries** (E1, E7):
   - When `nvm use` places an old Node's global bin dir first in PATH, a stale `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` installed under that Node version silently shadows the real CLI — `runClaudeCli` spawns the wrong binary and `claude auth status` may behave unexpectedly (e.g., reporting "not logged in" when the user is logged in under the current CLI).
   - `pnpm run doctor` now detects and warns when `which -a claude` finds multiple distinct real paths, listing them in PATH order.

6. **`claude auth status` requires login-shell Keychain context** (E1):
   - Fully stripped environments (e.g., `env -i`) report a false "not logged in" because the Keychain is unavailable without the user's login-shell context.
   - Bootstrap and `runClaudeCli` are expected to run from the operator's interactive login shell; CI/container use requires explicit credential forwarding.

| E7        | **PASS** (1,582 LOC)    | ✓            |          |
| E8        | **PASS + caveats**      | ✓            |          |

**Final Verdict:** Rivet engine meets technical requirements (E1–E5, E7–E8). Live progress (E4) confirmed functional with known caveats (no streaming, output discoverability). Authoring UX (E6) functional but rough; requires Yoke-side polish on approval flow, terminal prompts, and editor integration. Recommend adoption with documented UX backlog (see Operator Checklist defects).

Proceed to ADR-0011 (Rivet adoption, supersede bespoke orchestrator specs 008/010).
