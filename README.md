# Yoke

A modular, TypeScript workflow-control harness for LLM-driven software development.

Yoke turns a request into a **hardened spec** through an adversarial pipeline: intake → enrichment → parallel criticism and security review → assembly → approval gate → persisted ticket. Pipelines are defined once as provider-neutral data (YAML + prompt files) and executed by thin bindings to Claude, Mastra, or other runtimes.

## Charter

**What Yoke is.** A harness for building, editing and running dynamic workflows for
LLM-assisted software development. Workflows, steps, skills and agents are provider-neutral
templates stored as data. The same template runs against whichever model providers are
currently active.

**The goal.** One canonical definition, many execution backends. A workflow authored once
runs unchanged when the underlying provider changes — swapping providers is a registry edit,
not a rewrite.

**Operating surface.** Chat. Templates are files; creating and editing them is a chat and
file operation (ADR-0011). A visual workflow editor is desirable but no evaluated option has
met the bar, so it is deliberately out of scope until one does.

**Rules** (invariants, not preferences):

1. Provider portability is an acceptance criterion, not a feature — the same pipeline must
   run under at least two independent providers.
2. Layer-0 key isolation — no provider API keys in the Yoke process environment; child
   processes receive a scrubbed environment (ADR-0004).
3. The canon stays provider-neutral; anything harness-specific lives in a binding
   (ADR-0011).
4. One self-nesting `pipeline`; the leaf is `step`; the term "Action" is not used
   (ADR-0012).
5. No speculative abstraction — a layer appears when a second real consumer needs it.
6. Documentation is ADRs, lean specs and the code itself. No large design documents.
7. Anthropic-first is a current experiment, not an architectural commitment.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites (cannot be auto-installed):**

- Node ≥ 22: `nvm install 22` (`.nvmrc` pins the version)
- `claude` CLI installed and logged in: see https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code, then `claude auth login`

**Validate and generate:**

```sh
pnpm canon:check              # validate pipeline definitions
pnpm bindings:claude          # generate Claude Code workflow into .claude/workflows/
```

**Start the MCP server (via chat client):**

`.mcp.json` at the repo root wires the server into any MCP-capable client (Claude Code, VS Code with MCP, etc.). Open the repo in your client — it picks up the server automatically.

Manual workflow from the client:

1. Call `list_pipelines` to see available pipelines.
2. Call `run_pipeline` with `pipeline` and `inputs` to start a run.
3. If the run returns `status: "awaiting_approval"`, review the spec and call `approve` with the `runId`.
4. Call `get_run` at any time to check status.

**Switching providers:** edit the `YOKE_PROVIDER` value in `.mcp.json` (`anthropic` → `openai` or `local`) and restart the client. No pipeline or prompt changes needed.

```sh
pnpm mcp                      # also launchable standalone (stdio, for testing)
```

**Run the pipeline end-to-end (standalone):**

```sh
pnpm mastra:smoke             # execute pipeline with test input
pnpm mastra:smoke --db ./custom.sqlite --intake-model opus  # with flags
```

**Persist a hardened spec:**

```sh
echo '{"title":"T","description":"D"}' | pnpm persist --db ./yoke.sqlite
pnpm persist --file spec.json --db ./yoke.sqlite
```

**Preflight check:**

```sh
pnpm run doctor               # verify all prerequisites; fix hints for each missing item
```

## Optional: Rivet host and editor

Rivet was evaluated as a workflow engine and visual editor (ADR-0011); the engine passed but the operator experience did not, and the question of a visual editor is still open. This section is kept but is not the primary way to run Yoke.

**Additional prerequisites:**

- Rivet desktop app: `brew install --cask rivet`

**Launch Rivet host (starts on default port 21888):**

```sh
./bootstrap.sh                # installs deps, builds, runs doctor, starts Rivet host
# or manually:
pnpm rivet:host
```

**Attach the Rivet editor:**

1. Open Rivet.app
2. Action bar → Remote Debugger → connect to `ws://localhost:21888` (unauthenticated localhost WebSocket — **do not port-forward or expose remotely**)
3. File → Open → `rivet/spec-creation.rivet-project`

---

## Status

**Built (ready to use):**

- **Provider-neutral canon** — `pipelines/*.yaml` + `prompts/*.md` + loader (`src/canon/`); schema includes llm, gate, assemble-spec, persist-ticket; steps execute in parallel via `phase` grouping (ADR-0012).
- **Binding A** — Claude Code dynamic workflow generator (`.claude/workflows/*.js`, generated via `pnpm bindings:claude`); approval gates happen in chat between runs; subscription-billed; exit path is Binding B.
- **Binding B** — Mastra interpreter + MCP server (Apache-2.0); durable suspend/resume HITL; steps execute via the open model registry (`pnpm mcp` starts the server; `pnpm mastra:smoke` runs standalone).
- **Model registry** — open; CLI aliases + passthrough of any model id; local `claude`/`codex` CLIs on subscription auth, Ollama local models, keyed APIs via LiteLLM.
- **SQLite ticket store** — pipeline source of truth (better-sqlite3 + Drizzle); accepts persisted HardenedSpec JSON (via `pnpm persist --db ./yoke.sqlite`).
- **Layer-0 key isolation** — Yoke process environment holds no real provider keys; child processes receive scrubbed environment (Charter invariant).

## Current direction

**One canonical pipeline definition, many execution backends.** Chat-first operation via any MCP-capable client (Claude Code, Codex, or other). The same canon (provider-neutral YAML + prompts) runs unchanged against any configured model provider — swapping providers is a registry edit, not a code change (ADR-0011, ADR-0012). Provider portability is an acceptance criterion, enforced by smoke-testing the same pipeline under at least two independent bindings.

The visual workflow editor question remains open — no currently evaluated option meets the bar, so visual authoring is deliberately out of scope until one does. Rivet engine passed evaluation but UX needs work; kept in-repo as an optional path.

Current milestone: [`specs/013-provider-portable-templates`](specs/013-provider-portable-templates/spec.md) — validate full portability, close the registry, and harden the operator-facing APIs (canon validation, binding generation, ticket persistence).

## Development

**Prerequisites:** Node ≥ 22, pnpm, Docker (Compose v2), Pi CLI, `claude` CLI, `gh` (authenticated).

> Exact dependency versions pin on first `pnpm install` via `.npmrc save-exact`. The resulting `pnpm-lock.yaml` is committed and must be kept in sync.

```sh
# 1. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env          # fill in LITELLM_MASTER_KEY, LITELLM_VIRTUAL_KEY, GH_TOKEN

# 2. Start the stack (LiteLLM proxy + Postgres + Phoenix)
docker compose up -d postgres litellm phoenix

# 3. Install dependencies (pins exact versions, no lifecycle scripts)
pnpm install

# 4. Generate and apply DB migrations
pnpm db:generate && pnpm db:migrate

# 5. Run the CLI
pnpm dev harden -             # interactive free-text mode
pnpm dev harden 42            # seed from GitHub issue #42
```

**Quality gates** (run before commit):

```sh
pnpm lint          # ESLint + typescript-eslint (type-checked)
pnpm format:check  # Prettier
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript
pnpm test          # node:test suite (124+ tests)
```
